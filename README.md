# [Pebble Time watch face](https://vezquex.github.io/clock/watch-canvas.html)

Pebble Time was the 2nd and final iteration of a smart-watch from a startup that was later acquired by Fitbit, which was later acquired by Google.

The hardware had an always-on LCD display with a similar resolution to a Game Boy, but in portrait with 64 colors. My demo does not take advantage of the full resolution, opting for pixel doubling to ensure legibility, resulting in a blockier aesthetic.

The Pebble SDK isn't very useful unless you have the corresponding hardware, so this watch face demonstration uses HTML canvas.

# [Minimal Demo](https://vezquex.github.io/clock/minimal.html)
Similar to other pages, sans many features.

# [Pixel Font Demo](https://vezquex.github.io/clock/demo.html)

Supplementary content designed for the Pebble Time watch face page.

- Favicon clock
- Time offset slider
- Theme switcher
- Pixel font printouts
- Text colors
- Weather, color-coded
- Grid background (helps developer line up text visually)

The 5x5 pixel font is called _Bagua_, as 5 rows and columns is just enough resolution for a trigram. The font was made for this watch face because it can act much like a 7-segment display, with the added benefit of a saner approach to rendering the Roman alphabet and other symbols, typically in the ASCII character set.

# [Pixel Fonts HD](https://vezquex.github.io/clock/mip.html)
Modified to support more than one size of pixel font. Fonts comparable to some Japanese fitness watches, with desired adjustments.
